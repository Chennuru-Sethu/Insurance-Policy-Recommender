        <article class="article2"> Health insurance is a type of insurance coverage that pays for medical expenses incurred by the insured.
          Health insurance can reimburse the insured for expenses incurred from illness or injury, or pay the care provider directly. 
          There are different types of health insurance plans, such as individual health insurance, family health insurance, critical illness insurance, etc. 
          Purchasing a health insurance is an integral part of financial planning.
          Health insurance provides people with a much needed financial backup at times of medical emergencies, but it is an observed fact that till date,
          medical care in our country still remains largely as an expensive affair.

        Ayushman Bharat Yojana, and capital expenditure towards healthcare may ameliorate the situation.
