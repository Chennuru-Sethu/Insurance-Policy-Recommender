    <h1 id="h1">Why is Health Insurance Necessary ?</h1>
<div class="text">
        With the constant increasing prices of healthcare in our country, and with the ever rising instances of diseases, health insurance today is a necessity. Health insurance provides people with a much needed financial backup at times of medical emergencies. Health risks and uncertainties are a part of life. One cannot plan and get sick but one can certainly be prepared for the financial aspect. One of the ways to be financially prepared against uncertain health risks is by buying health insurance. <br>
Health insurance is a type of insurance coverage that pays for medical expenses incurred by the insured. Health insurance can reimburse the insured for expenses incurred from illness or injury, or pay the care provider directly. There are different types of health insurance plans, such as individual health insurance, family health insurance, critical illness insurance, etc. Purchasing a health insurance is an integral part of financial planning. <br>
Health insurance provides people with a much needed financial backup at times of medical emergencies, but it is an observed fact that till date, medical care in our country still remains largely as an expensive affair. According to various reports, India still continues to have the lowest health insurance penetration in the world. However, government's focus towards health schemes, new initiatives like, Ayushman Bharat Yojana, and capital expenditure towards healthcare may ameliorate the situation.
